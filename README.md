# PTU_Controller
A C++ library to control the [PhantomX Robot Turret Pan-Tilt Unit (PTU)](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/productdocs/Interbotix_Robot_Turret_Manual.pdf). 

This library assumes that the PhantomX PTU has the CommEXT.ino Arduino sketch loaded onto it. For instructions on how to do this, please visit the [PhantomX Robot Turret Getting Started Guide](https://learn.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix/robot-turrets/phantomx-turret). 

The protocol used to develop this library is described in the [PhantomX Robot Turret Manual](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/productdocs/Interbotix_Robot_Turret_Manual.pdf).
